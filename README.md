# sudoku-solver
 Solve sudoku puzzles, obviously.

## Instructions

 Download this repo as a zip, or alternatively clone it. Run the solver, `sudoku_solver.py`. It will attempt to solve all 291 puzzles in `sudoku_puzzles.py`. Currently, it solves 214 of them.

## What's included?

 A sudoku solver and a verifier, for sanity's sake.

## Contributing

 I welcome any _suggestions_ you may have. I emphasize _suggestions_ because I'm trying to work this out for myself, rather than copy and pasting other people's solutions. I'm just trying to further my understanding. Until I solve all 291 via my solver, this is strictly a one-man operation. Feel free to fork it and modify it, though. I wouldn't mind that at all.

### Extras

 I know my code is cluttered. It'll probably be that way until it's 100% functional. _Then_ I'll clean it up.
